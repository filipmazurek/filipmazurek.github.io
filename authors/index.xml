      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a second-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.https://ece.duke.edu/.edu/&#34;&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; advised by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/kenneth-brown&#34;&gt;Professor Ken Brown&lt;/a&gt;. My broad area of research is Quanutm Computing, and my main focus is working on support software for ion trap quantum computers. I am busy contributing to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax&#34;&gt;Duke ARTIQ Extensions&lt;/a&gt; (DAX), an open-source project from Duke University focused on adding traditional software abstractions on top of &lt;a href=&#34;https://m-labs.hk/experiment-control/artiq/&#34;&gt;ARTIQ&lt;/a&gt;, a leading control system for quantum information experiments. The goal of the project is to provide a framework that enables the development of modular and transparently layered software for quantum control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aim to expand DAX further, such as by adding realistic simulation of errors characterized by our actual quantum systems at Duke University. There already exist plans for a middle-level language called DAX.program that sits between higher-level languages such as Qiskit and DAX. My other research interests include strategies for compilation from higher-level languages such as Qiskit to DAX.program as well as optimization strategies for compiling DAX.program to DAX and ARTIQ, and the corresponding system pulses that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

My broad area of research is Quanutm Computing, and my main focus is working on support software for ion trap quantum computers. I am busy contributing to Duke ARTIQ Extensions (DAX), an open-source project from Duke University focused on adding traditional software abstractions on top of ARTIQ, a leading control system for quantum information experiments. The goal of the project is to provide a framework that enables the development of modular and transparently layered software for quantum control systems.\nI aim to expand DAX further, such as by adding realistic simulation of errors characterized by our actual quantum systems at Duke University. There already exist plans for a middle-level language called DAX.program that sits between higher-level languages such as Qiskit and DAX. My other research interests include strategies for compilation from higher-level languages such as Qiskit to DAX.program as well as optimization strategies for compiling DAX.program to DAX and ARTIQ, and the corresponding system pulses that come with it.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"http://www.github.io.filipmazurek/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a second-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University advised by Professor Ken Brown.
